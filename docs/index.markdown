Hi! Welcome to *Pay It Forward Climbing*. We would like to build a HOW TO GUIDE for giving back to the climbing community. :)

This website/platform is currently under construction. As a first step we would like to collect a list of grassroot organisations around the world that aims to provide more equitable access to climbing. If you think you know someone, please get in touch via: pifclimbing@gmail.com.
